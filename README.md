# Beef - Paid Dissent Platform

**"Put money where your mouth is."**

A platform that turns internet arguments into structured, monetized debates. No endless reply chains. Post a claim, price your conviction, and let the internet watch it burn in a controlled arena.

---

## 🎯 Core Concept

Beef transforms performative posting into structured contests where:
- **Conviction has a price** - Users put real money behind their claims
- **The arena has rules** - Structured 24-hour debate format with rounds
- **The crowd fuels the spectacle** - Spectators watch and place sidecards (predictions)
- **Judges determine winners** - AI panel + rubric scores determine outcomes
- **One appeal, then done** - Fair but firm dispute resolution

---

## 🚀 Features

### For Debaters

**Stage 1: Enter Arena**
- Browse debates freely without account
- Verify identity only when money is involved (KYC on-demand)

**Stage 2: Post a Claim**
- Write a claim (statement to debate)
- Choose debate type: Persuasion, Objective Claim, or Taste Battle
- Set your ante: $10, $25, $50, or $100
- Select category: Politics, Culture, Sports, Tech, or Callouts

**Stage 3: Match the Beef**
- Another user accepts and matches your ante
- 24-hour clock starts immediately

**Stage 4: Debate Live**
- **Round 1 (Opening)**: 220-character thesis statements
- **Round 2 (Receipts)**: Evidence round with links, screenshots, sources
- **Round 3 (Closing)**: Final arguments before judging

**Stage 5: Judge the Match**
- Panel of 3 AI models + published rubric
- Transparent decision trace and scoring
- Winner declared when clock expires or someone concedes

**Stage 6: Appeal Once**
- Single appeal allowed to keep platform firm but fair
- Appeal review by different judge panel

**Stage 7: Pay, Share, Repeat**
- Winner gets the pot
- Debate becomes part of public record
- Users build reputation with wins/losses

### For Spectators

- **Free to watch** - No account needed to view live debates
- **Sidecards** - Place predictions on debate outcomes (separate from main pot)
- **Follow debaters** - Track your favorite arguers
- **Crowd pulse** - See prediction splits (FIRE/FACTS/RECKLESS categories)
- **Comment feed** - Real-time reactions from spectators

### 🔥 Killer Feature: "Take This to Beef"

**One-button import from other platforms:**
- Scrape entire threads from X/Twitter, Discord, Reddit, 4chan
- Auto-generate claim from the argument
- Tag both parties (invite if not on platform)
- Original thread becomes "receipts" in the debate
- Viral loop: "We're taking this to Beef" becomes the new "1v1 me"

## 🎭 Product Philosophy

### What Must Be True

**Identity**
- Users browse freely, but money-moving actions require verified payment identity and region controls

**Moderation**
- Risky claims need category gating, claim framing rules, and escalation hooks before a match goes live

**Judging**
- Every resolved Beef needs a visible rubric, source record, decision trace, and one-appeal ceiling

**Separation**
- The debate pot, spectator sidecards, and crowd reactions must be distinct products in both UX and accounting
